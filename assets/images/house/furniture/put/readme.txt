copy the four set images from root/Isometric to this folder.
then open gimp. at the IMAGE menu, go to MODE then make sure that RGB is selected.

make sure that all images are the same size. resize all to the size of the NE image. Note that a kitchen counter might not be the same height as a kitchen sink. therefore, resize, the image set to the largest image then change the values in the client after all images are completed.

now the images can be put in frames. The second frame would be to resize the canvas width to 200 percent. The third frame is 150 percent and the last frame is 133.33 percent.

in gimp2, when scaling the images set image quality to none.

Copy the images in the order of SE, SW, NE, NW

----------------------

important read... sometimes the height of SE and SW are both noticeably bigger than NE and NW. its just that the top of that image is in a shape of a rectangle that changes when rotating. If NE and NW are bigger than SE and SW then rename NE and NW to SE and SW because its a display bug. 

in gimp, select NE and NW and go to image then canvas size. set the canvas size height to match the height of SE and SW. Move the offset y up until you cannot do that anymore. that will move the image down. see C:\Users\yourUserName\Desktop\clientDev\assets\images\house\furniture\put\21.png
