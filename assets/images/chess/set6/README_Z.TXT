                        TrueType Font CHESS LEIPZIG
                          Update: August 8, 1998.

  This font has been designed with figures found in  a  chess  book  of  the
beginning of this century.  The book was  printed  in  the  German  city  of
Leipzig, one of the major editorial centers of the world. The font was named
by Hans Bodlaender, webmaster of the page 'The Chess Variant Pages'  of  the
Universiteit Utrecht.  He sent me a copy of a chess diagram from the Leipzig
book.

  The drawings was created in Corel Draw 3.0 and exported to TTF  format  in
Corel Draw 7.0. I made the font in  the  "Colegio La Salle de San Cristobal"
(La Salle School of San Cristobal), located in the pleasant mountains of the
south  of  Mexico; in order to expand our collection  of  chess  fonts.  The
font is freeware, I hope it is useful for the chess buddies.  If you want to
repay us, you can send us some other fonts for creating chess  diagrams  (we 
are collecting them). Your comments and suggestions would be welcome; please
send them to either of address that appear below.

         LEIPFONT.TTF     CHESS LEIPZIG font - Ver. 1.1
         CHESLEIP.DOC     Sample and keymap.

  The font is installed in Windows, as in any other TTF  font.  It  will  be
helpful to you for making chess diagrams and figurine notation in  the  word
processors  which  are  run  under  Windows.  The  file  CHESLEIP.DOC  which
accompanies this file is made on  Word 6.0,  and contains a  sample  of  the 
creation of diagrams in a word proccesor and a keymap of this font. You will
not see these characters until the  'Chess Leipzig'  font  is  installed  in
your computer.  The distribution of the figures on the keyboard is the  same
as in the CHESS MARROQUIN font, as follows:

       Black king                        l                    L

* The EXTRA keys contain round corners.  The keys  (x),  (X),  (.), and  (:)
  contain auxiliary symbols to indicate individual movements of the  pieces.

NOTE: Also you find borders with the coordinates of chessboard.  For  simple
      borders, type the ASCII codes  from  0192  to  0207,  and  for  double
      borders from 0224 to 0239.  Don't forget to type [Alt]  and  the  ZERO
      which goes with each code to generate these characters. 
      
      The figurine notation pieces are in the ASCII codes from 0162 to 0167.

      I recommend you to print the .DOC file and see the complete keymap.
