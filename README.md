## GPL VS AGPL
```
    GPL: if you use any GPL code on your front-end, or any other code that is
    being “distributed” to users, your entire codebase needs to be open sourced. 
    You are free to use GPL on the server side without having to open source your code.

    AGPL: AGPL takes the above and applies it to the backend. So if you use any code 
    licensed under AGPL anywhere in your application, you need to release the source 
    code for your entire application.
