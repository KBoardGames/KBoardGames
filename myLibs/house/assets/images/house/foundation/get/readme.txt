copy the first image frame from a image at root/Isometric. if width is greater than height then scale image width to 84 pixels or if height is greater than width then scale height to 84 pixels. if image is smaller than 84 pixels then resize the canvas either width or height to 84 pixels then center it. That resize must resize the other value. if not then lock the image ratio.

next go to canvas size and set both width and height to 94 pixels. center the offset.

next go to filters/decor/add border and set border color to black. set delta value on color to 0. ser both border size to 3. save image. select assets\images\house\foundation\get then save to folder walls for a wall image or folder floors for a floor image.
