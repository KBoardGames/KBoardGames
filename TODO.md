## TODO

* At client game modules, remove all elements before the "new" call, so that memory does not grow which will slow down the client. The client becomes a bit more slower each time entering and exiting a scene.

* Create a new game. Either do a chess variant or captains mistress.

* At client are Reg._doStartGameOnce or Reg._roomIsLocked needed? Perhaps a lot more variables are no longer needed. Verify.

* Organize the client and server events.

* The software needs improved commenting. Lots of functions need a description. Lots of static variables need /* tags.

* Reg._buttonCodeValues and buttonCodeValues() are currently used in many class. Place those data into a single class?

* make the client look better or improve the layout.

* option to have dice in game. make dice feature.

* 100 chess puzzles is the goal.
